<h1>Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project showcases why a vulnerability scanner such as Nessus can be extremely useful and necessary. We set up a vulnerable machine and added an outdated version of Firefox to show the differences between the scans. We then took the information we gained from the scans and started with some vulnerability remediation. We will use 1 Virtual Machine (VM) which will be our vulnerable host, and my personal computer installed with Windows 11 to complete the Nessus scans on.

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

Setup for the Windows 10 Vulnerable Host:<br/>
<br/>
Network Adapter: Bridged<br/>
At least 2048 (2 GB) (I did 4 GB just to speed it up a little) base memory<br/>
The more processor core the better (I did 4 for this, but make sure your computer can handle it) <br />
